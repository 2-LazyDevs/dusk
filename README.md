# Dusk
Dusk is a W.I.P game engine. For now, the focus is to have a 2D editor (which will later be expanded to 3D). Dusk has only been tested on Linux (Zorin OS) so we don't know if Dusk would run on another platform. Cross-platform support is planned for the future.

## To Do:
- Add windowing & graphics ☑️
> [!NOTE]
> The renderer is super basic
- Use GLAD for graphics loading & GLFW for windowing ☑️
> [!NOTE]
> GLFW will be replaced with a custom windowing system later on
- Create a custom GUI
- Create a SCons file ☑️
- Add a input/output system ☑️
> [!NOTE]
> It is kinda buggy 😅
- Add comments to the code (In Progress)
- Make Dusk actually a game engine
